# Real-time-Facial-Expression-Recognition-and-Fast-Face-Detection
Real-time facial expression recognition and fast face detection based on Keras CNN. Training and testing on both Fer2013 and CK+ facial expression data sets have achieved good results. The speed is 78 fps on NVIDIA 1080Ti. If only face detection is performed, the speed can reach 158 fps. Finally, an emotional monitoring system was developed based on it.
